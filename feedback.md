You have good coverage of authorship comments, and your Git log shows a healthy use of Git.

Your game design is beautiful, and it includes a correct implementation of all of Marrakech's rules. I really love the
menu design, the music you have added, and the simple player selector that also lets a player swap in/out with an AI on
the fly.

Your AI is awesome, I really like the thought you have put into the heuristics to make the AI smart and appreciate that you
have fully documented it.

You have appropriate constructors for all classes, which properly initialize your game state. Your use of object-orientation
is excellent, with encapsulation of mutable fields, great use of class composition, and clear and logically named classes.

Your design is outstanding, with backend classes that are called by the testing methods as well as the main game, as well
as a smart use of inheritance to create custom JavaFX objects that are composed of your game objects with the fields 
necessary to display them.

Your comments are great, with clearly worded and correctly parametrized javadocs included for all classes as well as
in-line comments on longer methods.

Code quality is excellent, with appropriate use of newer java language features (enhanced switch, lambda expressions, enhanced for)
that make your code succinct and readable.

There is excellent coverage of unit tests for all new classes in the backend.

This is an outstanding submission! You have excelled in all areas of the assignment, all I can say is great job!

It's been a pleasure teaching all three of you this semester.
